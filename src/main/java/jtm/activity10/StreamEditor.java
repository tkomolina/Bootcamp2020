/*-
 * This is simple text stream editor. It reads text from file/standard input,
 * changes/deletes passed line and writes everything into file/standard output.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 * 
 * 1. number of line.
 *    If positive number, line is replaced/added into text,
 *    if negative, line is deleted from the text.
 * 2. Text to add/replace into specified line.
 *    If number is negative, enter dash (or whatever) as a padding
 *    for this parameter as it will be ignored.
 * 3. input file.
 *    If dash is specified, editor reads from standard input, otherwise it is file name.
 * 4. output file.
 *    If dash is specified, editor writes to standard input, otherwise it is file name.
 * HINTS:
 * 1. to pass parameters, you can run editor in terminal, for example, with following command:
 *   java -cp target/classes jtm.activity10.StreamEditor 2 aaaa - -
 * 2. to pass parameters for command in Eclipse, select:
 *   a) menu: Run — Run configurations...
 *   b) tree: Java applications — StreamEditor
 *   c) tab arguments, and field Program arguments, enter parameters there
 *   d) press Run
